# MongoDB Atlas Setup With Node.js

This demo project shows how you can use MongoDB Atlas with Node.js

See my [blog](http://dev-reboot.com/mongodb-atlas-node) for an explanation.

*note* The code will not work without a your own Mongo DB Atlas connection string.  See the blog about how you can get this.

## Development Server

1: Clone the repository and run `npm install`

2: Run `npm run start-server` to serve on `localhost:3000`
